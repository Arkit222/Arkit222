- 👋 Hi, I’m @Arkit222, a PhD-srudent in Theoretical Reaction Dynamics lab, IISER Kolkata.
- 👀 I’m interested in Quantum mechanics, quantum dynamics, solving partial differential equations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced python and look forward to learn Fortran for scientific computing as well. I'm also learning implementatin of deep neural network in the aforesaid fields of my interest, specifically on solving high-dimensinal PDE and quantum dynamics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Electron dynamics, constructing wavefunction using DNN and propagate the same in time under differrent strong perturbation.
